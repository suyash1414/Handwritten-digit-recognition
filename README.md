1. Deep learning :- deep learning is used in this project for image processing. convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for image processing and image detection.
                    I have used convolution, pooling, flattening and dense layers in my neural network. jupyter notebook is used for coding.
2. Opencv :- opencv is open source library for solving real-time computer vision problems, In this project i used opencv for working on realtime image. I used vscode for
             coding.
