1. Deep learning :- deep learning is used in this project for image processing. convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for image processing and image detection.
                    I have used convolution, pooling, flattening and dense layers in my neural network. jupyter notebook is used for coding.
2. Opencv :- opencv is open source library for solving real-time computer vision problems, In this project i used opencv for working on realtime image. I used vscode for
             coding.


+ app.py :- It is a python file , this file contain code with opencv library.
+ Digit_recognization.ipynb :- It is a jupyter notebook file, this contain machine learning model code for image processing and image detection with
                                           cnn model.
+ dataset :- This is an zip folder containing test and training data used for building deep learning model.
+ model.h5 :- This is an saved deep learning model created through machine learning code.
